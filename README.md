\# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning



\## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

The goal is to analyze transaction patterns and identify fraudulent activities.



\## Dataset

\- Publicly available credit card transaction dataset (Kaggle)

\- Highly imbalanced dataset



\## Key Steps

\- Data cleaning and preprocessing

\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

\- Handling class imbalance

\- Model training and evaluation



\## Evaluation Metrics

\- Accuracy

\- Precision

\- Recall

\- Confusion Matrix



\## Tools \& Technologies

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Matplotlib, Seaborn

\- Scikit-learn



\## Results

The model achieved high accuracy (>95%) while prioritizing recall for fraud detection.
